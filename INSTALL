Requirements
=======================================

The only required packages that must be installed to build the plugin
(besides Gtk+ and the GIMP) are:
  
  1) gimp version 2.0.0 or later
  2) pkg-config version 0.14 or later
  3) glut library version 3.7 or later
  4) GLEW library version 1.3.3 or later
    
For RedHat and Mandrake Linux distributions, you'll need to have the 'devel'
RPMs installed for Gtk+, Glib and GIMP.

Building for Windows with mingw
=======================================

To compile the plugin for use with the Windows version of GIMP you'll need
to use the MingW environment (http://www.mingw.org).  You'll need to install
the runtime and development packages for the following libraries:

   1) gimp 2.x
   2) glib2
   3) gtk+2
   4) pango
   5) atk
   6) pkg-config
   7) glut
   8) GLEW
   
To build, type "make WIN32=1"
     
Installation
=======================================

1. Type 'make' to build the plugin
2. Type 'make install' to install the plugin. By default the plugin will be
installed in your GIMP user plugin directory ($HOME/.gimp-2.2/plug-ins).  If
you want to install the plugin system-wide, as root you must manually copy the
plugin to the system GIMP plugin directory.
